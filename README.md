This is a simple file manager written by me using the filesystem library and fstream.
Because there is very little information on the Internet about the library 
for working with directives. I'll leave this here for everyone to see as an example
of how this library works.

I commented on the name and implementation of all
functions in the code. You can check it out there and try 
it at the same time.
